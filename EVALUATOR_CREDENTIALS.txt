# EVALUATOR SETUP - All Credentials Included

## 🎓 For Teaching Assistants / Evaluators

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: All credentials are already configured in the project files for your convenience. You do NOT need to create any Firebase, MongoDB, or Redis accounts. Everything is ready to use!

### Why Credentials Are Included

**For ease of evaluation**, we have included all necessary credentials directly in the configuration files:
- `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` - Backend configuration
- `frontend/.env` - Frontend configuration

**This is intentionally done to:**
1. Save evaluator time - no account creation needed
2. Ensure consistent testing environment
3. Make evaluation process smooth and quick
4. Focus on code quality rather than setup complexity

**Security Note**: These credentials will be removed from the repository after evaluation. They are temporary evaluation credentials with limited access.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes Setup)

### Prerequisites (Must be installed):
- **Java 21** ([Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21))
- **Maven 3.6+** ([Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
- **Node.js v16+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))

### Setup Steps:

**1. Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YashGupta2106/Shatranj_Art_Of_War.git
cd Shatranj_Art_Of_War
```

**2. Run Backend**
```bash
cd backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

# Wait for: "Started DemoApplication in X.XXX seconds"
# Backend runs on http://localhost:8080
```

**3. Run Frontend** (in new terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# Opens browser at http://localhost:3000
```

**4. Run Tests** (to verify)
```bash
cd backend
mvn test

# Expected: Tests run: 59, Failures: 0, Errors: 0
```

## 🎮 Testing the Application

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST Use Two Different Browsers!

> **DO NOT use Incognito/Private mode** - JWT tokens won't persist!

**How to Test Gameplay:**
```
1. Browser 1 (Chrome):   http://localhost:3000 → Login as guptaji@gmail.com
2. Browser 2 (Firefox):  http://localhost:3000 → Login as ash@gmail.com
3. Both click "Find Match"
4. Game starts - make moves and see them sync in real-time!
```

**Pre-configured Test Accounts:**
- **Account 1**: `guptaji@gmail.com` / Password: `guptaji`
- **Account 2**: `ash@gmail.com` / Password: `guptaji`

**Why Two Browsers?**
- ❌ Same browser = Session conflict
- ❌ Incognito mode = JWT tokens won't persist (login will fail!)
- ✅ Two different browsers (Chrome + Firefox) = Works perfectly!

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
mvn test

# Expected Output:
# Tests run: 59, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1
# BUILD SUCCESS
```

**Generate Coverage Report:**
```bash
mvn test jacoco:report

# Open: backend/target/site/jacoco/index.html
# Expected coverage: 65-70%
```

## � Configuration Details (For Reference Only)

All these are already configured - you don't need to change anything!

### Backend: `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`
- MongoDB, Firebase, Redis credentials included
- CORS enabled for localhost:3000
- Server port: 8080

### Frontend: `frontend/.env`
- Firebase configuration included
- Backend URLs configured
- Ready to use

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**
```bash
# Check Java version (must be 21)
java -version

# Clean and rebuild
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Frontend won't start:**
```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```

**Tests failing:**
```bash
# Should pass without any credentials
mvn clean test
```

**Can't login:**
- Make sure you're using two DIFFERENT browsers (not incognito)
- Use provided credentials: guptaji@gmail.com / guptaji

**Matchmaking not working:**
- You need TWO users in TWO different browsers
- Both must click "Find Match" at the same time
- Wait 2-3 seconds for automatic matching

## 📝 Summary

**What you need to do:**
1. ✅ Clone repository
2. ✅ Run `mvn spring-boot:run` (backend)
3. ✅ Run `npm start` (frontend)
4. ✅ Open two different browsers
5. ✅ Login with provided accounts
6. ✅ Test the game!

**What you DON'T need to do:**
- ❌ Create Firebase account
- ❌ Create MongoDB account
- ❌ Set up Redis
- ❌ Configure environment variables
- ❌ Register new users (test accounts provided)

**Everything is ready to use!** 🚀

## � Security Note

These credentials are:
- Temporary evaluation credentials
- Limited access/quotas
- Will be removed after evaluation
- Included solely for TA convenience

This approach was chosen to streamline the evaluation process and ensure a consistent testing environment for all evaluators.
